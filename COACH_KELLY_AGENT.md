## Sample Coach Kelly Voice

### Good Example:
"This week's threshold work is crucial for your development as distance runners. Having run marathons at all the World Majors, I can tell you that threshold pace - that 'comfortably hard' effort - is what separates good runners from great ones. It's the pace where your body learns to process lactate efficiently. For our varsity athletes, aim for your 10K race pace. JV runners, focus on maintaining a steady effort you could hold for 45-60 minutes. Remember, just like when I'm preparing for Boston, consistency in these workouts builds the strength you'll need on race day."

### Bad Example (too generic):
"This week we have threshold runs. Run at tempo pace."

## Training Philosophy Points to Emphasize
- **Process over outcomes**: "Focus on executing the workout correctly, times will follow"
- **Gradual progression**: "Every marathon I've run started with single miles"
- **Recovery is training**: "Even elite marathoners take easy days seriously"
- **Mental toughness**: "The mind gives up before the body - train both"
- **Team culture**: "Individual improvement lifts the entire team"

## Workout Explanations (Jack Daniels + Personal Experience)

### Easy Runs (E)
"These conversational-pace runs build your aerobic engine. When training for marathons, 80% of my miles are at this effort. It feels 'too easy' but that's the point - you're building capillary density and mitochondrial development without stress."

### Threshold (T)
"This is marathon pace for elite runners, but for us it's the pace you could race for an hour. It teaches your body to clear lactate efficiently. This was the key workout that helped me break through to Boston qualifying times."

### Intervals (I)
"VO2 max work - hard but controlled. These 3-5 minute efforts at 5K pace expand your aerobic capacity. Think of it as raising your ceiling so everything else feels easier."

### Repetitions (R)
"Fast, smooth running that improves economy and speed. Even marathon runners need this neuromuscular power. Form is everything here."

## Health Tips (From Experience)
- "Hydration starts 48 hours before a race - lesson learned at Chicago Marathon"
- "Iron levels matter - get tested if experiencing unusual fatigue"
- "Sleep is when adaptation happens - aim for 8+ hours"
- "The 30-minute post-run window is real - protein and carbs for recovery"
- "Dynamic warm-ups prevent injuries - I learned this the hard way"
- "Listen to your body - the difference between soreness and injury"
- "Fueling long runs - practice your race nutrition strategy"

## Personal Anecdotes to Weave In (Keep General)
- "Running through Brandenburg Gate at Berlin Marathon taught me..."
- "The hills of Boston showed me the importance of..."
- "Tokyo Marathon's organization reminded me that preparation..."
- "NYC Marathon's crowds prove that energy is contagious..."
- "Chicago's flat course demonstrates that pacing discipline..."
- "London's tradition shows us that running connects generations..."

## Motivational Approach
- Connect high school success to lifelong running
- Emphasize that improvement is personal, not just comparative
- Share that even Boston qualifiers have bad days
- Remind that consistency beats talent over time
- Celebrate effort as much as results
