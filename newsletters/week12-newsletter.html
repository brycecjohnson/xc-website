    <h2>üí¨ A NOTE FROM YOUR COACHES</h2>
    <div class="coach-note">
        <p>Hawks, what an incredible season this has been! Whether you're racing at State this Saturday or wrapping up your season this week, you've all grown tremendously as athletes and teammates.</p>

        <p><strong>For Our State Qualifiers:</strong></p>

        <p>This is the culmination of everything you've worked for - early morning runs, challenging workouts, mental toughness on hard days, and unwavering commitment to the team. The State Meet is where Colorado's best high school cross country runners compete, and you've earned your place among them.</p>

        <p>This week's training follows Jack Daniels' championship taper philosophy: maintain sharpness while maximizing recovery. Monday's easy run keeps your legs moving without stress. Tuesday's individual workout maintains your routine. Wednesday's shakeout with strides keeps your neuromuscular system primed. Thursday is complete rest - trust the taper and let your body fully recover. Friday's quick shakeout loosens you up for race day.</p>

        <p>At the State Meet, race with confidence and courage. Trust your training, execute your race plan, and when it gets hard in that final mile, remember that every athlete out there is hurting - the ones who finish strongest are the ones who push through. You've prepared for this moment all season long.</p>

        <p><strong>For Athletes Not Racing at State:</strong></p>

        <p>Your contributions to this team have been invaluable. Cross country is a team sport, and every practice, every workout, every mile you ran helped make this team better. The culture you helped create pushed everyone to improve.</p>

        <p>This week's practice schedule gives you flexibility while celebrating the season. Monday's time trial lets you measure your progress - compare it to where you started and see how far you've come! The rest of the week offers opportunities to finish strong alongside your teammates. While practice is optional, we hope you'll choose to be there - your presence and support means everything to both your teammates and coaches.</p>

        <p><strong>To The Entire Team:</strong></p>

        <p>Whether you're racing Saturday or cheering from the sidelines, we want to see this team together one more time. The bonds you've built this season extend beyond racing - you're a family. Let's finish this season the way we've run it all year: together, with pride, supporting one another.</p>

        <p>Check TeamSnap regularly for State Meet updates, banquet information, and other end-of-season details. Thank you for an unforgettable season!</p>

    <h2>üèÉ HEALTH TIP OF THE WEEK</h2>
    <div class="health-tip">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">State Meet Week Preparation</h3>
        <p><strong>Sleep (State Athletes):</strong> Aim for 9+ hours every night this week. Tuesday and Wednesday nights are especially critical - the sleep you get 2-3 nights before the race matters more than Friday night sleep.</p>
        <p><strong>Hydration:</strong> Consistent water intake throughout the week. Pale yellow urine indicates proper hydration. Don't try to "catch up" on hydration Friday night - start early in the week.</p>
        <p><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Maintain your normal, healthy diet Monday-Thursday. Friday, slightly increase carbohydrates at meals (extra rice, pasta, or sweet potatoes). Saturday breakfast should be familiar foods eaten 3-4 hours before your race - no experiments on race day!</p>
        <p><strong>Mental Preparation:</strong> Visualize the State Meet course and your race plan. See yourself running strong, handling tough moments, and finishing with everything you have. State Meet nerves are normal - channel that energy into your performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Rest and Recovery:</strong> Limit intense physical activity outside of practice. Avoid standing for long periods. Elevate your legs when watching TV. Let your body store energy for Saturday.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="quote-box">
        <div class="quote-text">"Championships are won at practice."</div>
        <div class="quote-author">- Bill Rodgers</div>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.95em; font-style: normal;">Every hot afternoon run, every interval session, every long Saturday run - they all led to this moment. Whether you're racing at State or celebrating a complete season, the work you put in during practice has already made you a champion. Now it's time to show what you've built!</p>
