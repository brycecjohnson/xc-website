    <h2>üí¨ A NOTE FROM YOUR COACHES</h2>
    <div class="coach-note">
        <p>Hawks, welcome to Week 10 - our final hard training week before Regionals! With no races this week, we're focusing on building peak fitness through challenging workouts. This schedule follows the Jack Daniels methodology and represents a demanding week of training:</p>

        <p><strong>Why This Week is Hard:</strong></p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Tuesday's Intervals (6-5 x 800m):</strong> These 800-meter repeats at 5K pace are VO‚ÇÇmax work - developing your body's ability to process oxygen at maximal levels. The volume (6 reps for varsity) and intensity make this a challenging session, but it's exactly what you need one week out from Regionals.</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Wednesday's Threshold Run (4-2.5 miles):</strong> Following intervals with a tempo run means you'll be working at threshold pace on legs that aren't fully recovered. This teaches your body to perform when tired - just like the last mile of a race. The increased distance makes this more demanding than previous threshold work.</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Friday's Repetitions (8-6 x 400m):</strong> Running at mile pace (faster than 5K pace) after two hard workouts develops speed and running economy. These shorter, faster reps train your neuromuscular system and improve your finishing kick.</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Saturday's Long Run (8-9 miles):</strong> This is your final long run before Regionals. The increased mileage builds mental toughness and ensures your aerobic base is solid heading into championship season.</p>

        <p><strong>Important Reminders:</strong></p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Recovery Matters:</strong> With three hard workouts this week, Monday and Thursday's easy runs are crucial. Easy means EASY - conversational pace only. Your body adapts during recovery, not during the hard work.</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Get on the Track:</strong> If possible, use a track for Tuesday and Friday's workouts. Accurate pacing is important for these quality sessions.</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Run with Friends:</strong> This week is tough. Training with teammates makes hard workouts manageable and fun. Text your teammates today to set up meeting times!</p>

        <p>This is where championships are won - during the "invisible" training days when no one is watching. Complete these workouts with focus and determination, and you'll arrive at Regionals ready to race your best. Next week we'll taper, sharpen, and prepare to show Colorado what Skyview Hawks are made of!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>üèÉ TRAINING TIP OF THE WEEK</h2>
    <div class="health-tip">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Managing a Hard Training Week</h3>
        <p>This week's schedule is intentionally challenging - here's how to handle it successfully:</p>
        <p><strong>Respect the Easy Days:</strong> Monday and Thursday are truly easy. Running too hard on recovery days will compromise your hard workouts and increase injury risk. If you can't hold a conversation, you're going too fast.</p>
        <p><strong>Nail Your Paces:</strong> Don't run Tuesday's intervals faster than 5K pace or Friday's reps faster than mile pace. The prescribed paces provide optimal training stimulus. Running faster just leaves you tired without additional benefit.</p>
        <p><strong>Fuel Properly:</strong> Hard training requires adequate nutrition. Don't skip meals or drastically change your diet during Fall Break. Carbohydrates are your friend this week.</p>
        <p><strong>Sleep is Training:</strong> Your body repairs and adapts during sleep. Aim for 8-9 hours nightly, especially after hard workout days. Late nights hurt performance more than you realize.</p>
        <p><strong>Listen to Your Body:</strong> Hard week doesn't mean injury-risking week. If something hurts (not tired, but actually hurts), be smart. Contact coaches via TeamSnap immediately if you have pain concerns.</p>

        <div class="quote-text">"Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second."</div>
        <div class="quote-author">- William James</div>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.95em; font-style: normal;">This week tests your second wind - your ability to push through when the first burst of motivation fades. No coaches watching, no team practice structure, just you and your determination. Champions embrace hard weeks like this because they know Regionals success is built during the "invisible" training days. Get after it, Hawks!</p>
