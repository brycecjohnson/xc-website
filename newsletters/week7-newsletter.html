    <h2>üí≠ A Note from Your Coaches</h2>

    <p>Team,</p>

    <p>This week marks our transition into the heart of the racing season! After last week's heavy race schedule, we're implementing a strategic adjustment to our training rhythm. By moving our quality workout to Tuesday, we're giving you optimal recovery time while still maintaining the sharpness needed for Friday's competition.</p>

    <p>Tuesday's 400m repetitions are designed according to Jack Daniels' R-pace principles - these aren't all-out sprints, but controlled efforts at your mile race pace. This workout develops neuromuscular power and running economy, which translates directly to a stronger finishing kick in your 5K races. Remember: the purpose is quality, not quantity. Focus on maintaining consistent splits and proper form throughout each repetition.</p>

    <p>The Dave Sanders Invitational is a significant meet with strong competition from across the metro area. The Clement Park course features rolling hills and a challenging finish, so pace yourselves accordingly. Start conservatively, work the middle mile, and use that speed we've been developing for a strong finish.</p>

    <p>This meet is an excellent opportunity to test your racing tactics against quality competition. Work together as a pack through the first mile, then make your moves based on how you feel. Focus on running even splits and executing the race strategy we've been practicing. Every race is a chance to learn something new about yourself as a competitor and contribute to our team's success.</p>

    <p>Remember: Championships aren't won in September - they're won by doing the work in September that prepares you for October and November. Trust the process!</p>

    <h2>ü•ó Health Tip of the Week: Race Week Nutrition</h2>

    <div class="success-box">
        <strong>Optimizing Your Fuel for Friday's Race:</strong>

        <p><strong>Monday-Wednesday:</strong> Focus on complex carbohydrates at every meal. Include whole grains, sweet potatoes, quinoa, and plenty of fruits and vegetables. This is NOT the time to try new foods or restaurants!</p>

        <p><strong>Thursday (Day Before):</strong> Increase your carbohydrate intake slightly (about 10-15% more than normal). Drink water consistently throughout the day - your urine should be pale yellow. Avoid high-fiber foods at dinner to prevent GI distress during the race.</p>

        <p><strong>Friday (Race Day):</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Breakfast:</strong> Eat your normal breakfast - something you know sits well</li>
            <li><strong>Lunch:</strong> Light meal before 12:30 PM - sandwich, fruit, and water work well</li>
            <li><strong>2 Hours Before:</strong> Small snack if needed - banana, granola bar, or toast with honey</li>
            <li><strong>1 Hour Before:</strong> Stop eating solid foods, small sips of water only</li>
            <li><strong>Post-Race:</strong> Eat within 30 minutes! Chocolate milk, fruit, and a sandwich are perfect</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Hydration Protocol:</strong> Aim for half your body weight in ounces of water daily this week. On race day, stop heavy fluid intake 1 hour before your race to avoid side stitches. After the race, gradually rehydrate - don't gulp!</p>
    </div>

    <h2>üí™ Quote of the Week</h2>

    <div class="quote-box">
        "Run when you can, walk if you have to, crawl if you must; just never give up."
        <div class="quote-author">- Dean Karnazes, Ultramarathon Man</div>
    </div>

    <p>This powerful message from ultrarunning legend Dean Karnazes reminds us that persistence matters more than perfection. As you tackle the hills at Clement Park on Friday, there will be moments when the pace feels hard, when that final climb tests your resolve. But remember - it's not about running perfectly, it's about never giving up. Whether you're fighting for a PR or simply working to stay with your pack, keep moving forward. Your teammates are counting on you, and every step you take, no matter how difficult, brings the team closer to success.</p>

    <div class="info-box">
