    <h2>üí¨ A NOTE FROM YOUR COACHES</h2>
    <div class="coach-note">
        <p>Hawks, what an incredible performance at the Mile High League meet! Special congratulations to Rylan for winning the league championship - your hard work and dedication have truly paid off! Maggie and Elena, your All-Conference honors are well-deserved recognition of your consistent excellence throughout the season.</p>

        <p>As we head into Fall Break, remember that championships are won during the "invisible" training days - the days when no one is watching, when you have to self-motivate. The workouts prescribed for this week and next follow the Jack Daniels methodology we've used all season:</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Tuesday's Threshold Run (T pace):</strong> This tempo effort at your lactate threshold pace (roughly 10K race pace) maintains your ability to clear lactate efficiently. With Regionals approaching, we're not trying to raise your threshold - we're maintaining it at peak levels.</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Thursday's Intervals (I pace):</strong> These 1000m repeats at 5K pace maintain your VO‚ÇÇmax - your body's maximum oxygen processing capacity. The 2-minute recoveries allow partial but not complete recovery, teaching your body to perform when not fully rested, just like the middle miles of a race.</p>

        <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Saturday's Long Run:</strong> This aerobic effort continues building your mitochondrial density and capillary networks. Even during the championship phase, maintaining your aerobic base is crucial for race-day endurance.</p>

        <p><strong>Running is more fun together!</strong> Please coordinate with your teammates to meet up for workouts. Not only will this help you push each other, but it maintains the team chemistry we've built all season. Use the TeamSnap app to organize meeting times and locations.</p>

        <p>With Regionals on October 23rd, these next two weeks are crucial. Stay consistent with your training, get plenty of sleep, and maintain good nutrition even while on break. You've shown what you're capable of - now let's prepare to showcase it at the championship meets!</p>

    <h2>üèÉ TRAINING TIP OF THE WEEK</h2>
    <div class="health-tip">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Self-Directed Training During Fall Break</h3>
        <p>Training on your own requires extra discipline and smart planning. Here's how to make the most of Fall Break training:</p>
        <p><strong>Schedule It:</strong> Treat your runs like appointments. Set a specific time each day and stick to it. Morning runs often work best during break - get it done before the day gets away from you.</p>
        <p><strong>Find a Partner:</strong> Text your teammates tonight to set up training times. Even meeting for 2-3 workouts makes a huge difference in motivation and performance.</p>
        <p><strong>Location Variety:</strong> Use Fall Break to explore new running routes. This mental freshness can make solo runs more enjoyable. Just make sure to measure distances accurately.</p>
        <p><strong>Pace Discipline:</strong> Without coaches watching, it's tempting to run too fast on easy days or too slow on workout days. Stick to the prescribed paces - they're designed for optimal Regionals preparation.</p>
        <p><strong>Recovery Matters:</strong> With no structured practice schedule, don't forget recovery. Easy means EASY. Your body adapts during rest, not just during hard work.</p>

        <div class="quote-text">"The difference between the impossible and the possible lies in a person's determination."</div>
        <div class="quote-author">- Tommy Lasorda</div>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.95em; font-style: normal;">Fall Break is where champions separate themselves from the pack. Your determination to train when no one is watching, to meet up with teammates when you could stay in bed, to push through workouts when there's no coach present - that's what will make the difference at Regionals. Stay hungry, Hawks!</p>
