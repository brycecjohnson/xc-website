    <h2>üí¨ A NOTE FROM YOUR COACHES</h2>
    <div class="coach-note">
        <p>Hawks, this is the week we've been working toward all season! Regionals is where everything comes together - all the early morning runs, the hard track workouts, the long Saturday runs, the discipline on easy days. You're ready for this moment.</p>

        <p><strong>About This Week's Training:</strong></p>

        <p>We're following a championship taper this week, which means reducing volume while maintaining sharpness. Monday's track workout is your final quality session before Regionals - 400m repeats at mile pace develop speed and neuromuscular power without creating excessive fatigue. Focus on relaxed, controlled speed rather than all-out sprints.</p>

        <p>Tuesday and Wednesday are all about recovery and staying loose. These easy runs keep blood flowing to your muscles and maintain your running rhythm without tiring you out. The Wednesday shakeout with strides primes your neuromuscular system for Thursday's race effort.</p>

        <p><strong>Championship Mindset:</strong></p>

        <p>Regionals is a team race with individual performances. Your placement matters not just for your personal achievement but for our team's advancement to State. Every position counts - the difference between 4th place (State qualification) and 5th place (season over) often comes down to a single runner's placement.</p>

        <p>This meet rewards smart racing: controlled starts, strong middle miles, and gutsy finishes. Trust your training, run your race, and support your teammates. When it gets hard in that final mile, remember that every athlete out there is hurting - the ones who push through are the ones who advance.</p>

        <p>Check TeamSnap throughout the week for course maps and additional meet details. Get plenty of sleep, eat well, stay hydrated, and approach Thursday with confidence. You've earned this opportunity - now go seize it!</p>

    <h2>üèÉ HEALTH TIP OF THE WEEK</h2>
    <div class="health-tip">
        <h3 style="margin-top: 0;">Championship Week Preparation</h3>
        <p><strong>Sleep:</strong> Aim for 9 hours Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday nights. The night before the race matters less than the two nights before - prioritize Tuesday and Wednesday sleep.</p>
        <p><strong>Hydration:</strong> Drink water consistently throughout the week. Your urine should be pale yellow. Don't wait until Wednesday to start hydrating - begin now.</p>
        <p><strong>Nutrition:</strong> Maintain your normal diet Monday-Tuesday. Wednesday, slightly increase carbohydrates (add extra rice, pasta, or sweet potatoes at meals). Thursday breakfast should be familiar foods eaten 3-4 hours before your race.</p>
        <p><strong>Mental Preparation:</strong> Visualize the race - see yourself executing your race plan, handling tough moments, and finishing strong. Championship races are won in the mind as much as the body.</p>
        <p><strong>Pre-Race Routine:</strong> Arrive early, complete a thorough warm-up (2 miles easy + strides), use the bathroom, and get to the start line relaxed but focused. Nervous energy is normal - channel it into your performance.</p>

    <div class="quote-box">
        <div class="quote-text">"It's very hard in the beginning to understand that the whole idea is not to beat the other runners. Eventually you learn that the competition is against the little voice inside you that wants you to quit."</div>
        <div class="quote-author">- George Sheehan</div>
        <p style="margin-top: 15px; font-size: 0.95em; font-style: normal;">At Regionals, you'll face that voice - the one that whispers doubt when your legs burn and your lungs scream. The athletes who advance to State are the ones who answer that voice with determination and keep pushing. You've trained for this moment. Trust yourself, trust your teammates, and silence that doubt with action!</p>
